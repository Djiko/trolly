# [Trolly](http://github.com/djiko/trolly)

Trolly is a shopping list application for android, aiming at being very simple : no annoying, complicated or unnecessary features.
Trolly has initially been released by [Ben Caldwell](https://code.google.com/p/trolly/) as a [GPL V3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) open source project.

This repository contains a bug fixing version. As an early adopter and every-day-user, I keep maintaining the application when I have some time to spend on it.

This version is currently not available in the Play Store. If someone takes care of packaging it, you may find it in F-Droid.

## Features

Trolly lets you create shopping lists, keeps track of added product and helps you manage your shopping time by giving you a quick and easy access to the list.

## Licence

Trolly is a free software released under the GPL V3 licence.

### TODO: Improvements (someday)
  * UI -> implement the action bar
  * Cleaning the cached product list is not that intuitive. There may be some improvements to do there.
  * follow up prices and shops : why not logging shops and prices ? Maybe compare shops for the same list
  * Create list from reference list : build a reference list and create new list from it
  * Posting and getting lists over http to share your lists
  * Getting product image over http
